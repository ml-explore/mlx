Quick Start Guide
=================

MLX is a NumPy-like array framework designed for efficient and flexible
machine learning on Apple silicon. The Python API closely follows NumPy with
a few exceptions. MLX also has a fully featured C++ API which closely follows
the Python API.

The main differences between MLX and NumPy are: 

 - **Composable function transformations**: MLX has composable function
   transformations for automatic differentiation, automatic vectorization,
   and computation graph optimization.
 - **Lazy computation**: Computations in MLX are lazy. Arrays are only
   materialized when needed.
 - **Multi-device**: Operations can run on any of the supported devices (CPU,
   GPU, ...) 

The design of MLX is strongly inspired by frameworks like `PyTorch
<https://pytorch.org/>`_, `Jax <https://github.com/google/jax>`_, and
`ArrayFire <https://arrayfire.org/>`_. A noteable difference from these
frameworks and MLX is the *unified memory model*. Arrays in MLX live in shared
memory. Operations on MLX arrays can be performed on any of the supported
device types without performing data copies. Currently supported device types
are the CPU and GPU.

Basics
------

.. currentmodule:: mlx.core

Import ``mlx.core`` and make an :class:`array`:

.. code-block:: python

  >> import mlx.core as mx
  >> a = mx.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
  >> a.shape
  [4]
  >> a.dtype
  int32
  >> b = mx.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
  >> b.dtype
  float32

Operations in MLX are lazy. The outputs of MLX operations are not computed
until they are needed. To force an array to be evaluated use
:func:`eval`.  Arrays will automatically be evaluated in a few cases. For
example, inspecting a scalar with :meth:`array.item`, printing an array,
or converting an array from :class:`array` to :class:`numpy.ndarray` all
automatically evaluate the array.

.. code-block:: python

  >> c = a + b    # c not yet evaluated
  >> mx.eval(c)  # evaluates c
  >> c = a + b
  >> print(c)     # Also evaluates c
  array([2, 4, 6, 8], dtype=float32)
  >> c = a + b
  >> import numpy as np
  >> np.array(c)   # Also evaluates c
  array([2., 4., 6., 8.], dtype=float32)

Function and Graph Transformations
----------------------------------

MLX has standard function transformations like :func:`grad` and :func:`vmap`.
Transformations can be composed arbitrarily. For example
``grad(vmap(grad(fn)))`` (or any other composition) is allowed.

.. code-block:: python

  >> x = mx.array(0.0)
  >> mx.sin(x)
  array(0, dtype=float32)
  >> mx.grad(mx.sin)(x)
  array(1, dtype=float32)
  >> mx.grad(mx.grad(mx.sin))(x)
  array(-0, dtype=float32)

Other gradient transformations include :func:`vjp` for vector-Jacobian products
and :func:`jvp` for Jacobian-vector products.

Use :func:`value_and_grad` to efficiently compute both a function's output and
gradient with respect to the function's input.
