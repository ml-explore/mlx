LLM inference
==============

MLX enables efficient inference of large-ish transformers on Apple silicon
without compromising on ease of use. In this example we will create an
inference script for the Llama family of transformer models in which the model
is defined in less than 200 lines of python.

Implementing the model
----------------------

We will use the neural network building blocks defined in the :mod:`mlx.nn`
module to concisely define the model architecture. 

Attention layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will start with the llama attention layer which notably uses the RoPE
positional encoding. [1]_ In addition, our attention layer will optionally use a
key/value cache that will be concatenated with the provided keys and values to
support efficient inference.

Our implementation uses :class:`mlx.nn.Linear` for all the projections and
:class:`mlx.nn.RoPE` for the positional encoding.

.. code-block:: python

    import mlx.core as mx
    import mlx.nn as nn

    class LlamaAttention(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, dims: int, num_heads: int):
            super().__init__()

            self.num_heads = num_heads

            self.rope = nn.RoPE(dims // num_heads, traditional=True)
            self.query_proj = nn.Linear(dims, dims, bias=False)
            self.key_proj = nn.Linear(dims, dims, bias=False)
            self.value_proj = nn.Linear(dims, dims, bias=False)
            self.out_proj = nn.Linear(dims, dims, bias=False)

        def __call__(self, queries, keys, values, mask=None, cache=None):
            queries = self.query_proj(queries)
            keys = self.key_proj(keys)
            values = self.value_proj(values)

            # Extract some shapes
            num_heads = self.num_heads
            B, L, D = queries.shape

            # Prepare the queries, keys and values for the attention computation
            queries = queries.reshape(B, L, num_heads, -1).transpose(0, 2, 1, 3)
            keys = keys.reshape(B, L, num_heads, -1).transpose(0, 2, 1, 3)
            values = values.reshape(B, L, num_heads, -1).transpose(0, 2, 1, 3)

            # Add RoPE to the queries and keys and combine them with the cache
            if cache is not None:
                key_cache, value_cache = cache
                queries = self.rope(queries, offset=key_cache.shape[2])
                keys = self.rope(keys, offset=key_cache.shape[2])
                keys = mx.concatenate([key_cache, keys], axis=2)
                values = mx.concatenate([value_cache, values], axis=2)
            else:
                queries = self.rope(queries)
                keys = self.rope(keys)

            # Finally perform the attention computation
            scale = math.sqrt(1 / queries.shape[-1])
            scores = (queries * scale) @ keys.transpose(0, 1, 3, 2)
            if mask is not None:
                scores = scores + mask
            scores = mx.softmax(scores, axis=-1)
            values_hat = (scores @ values).transpose(0, 2, 1, 3).reshape(B, L, -1)

            # Note that we return the keys and values to possibly be used as a cache
            return self.out_proj(values_hat), (keys, values)

Encoder layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The other component of the Llama model is the encoder layer which uses RMS
normalization [2]_ and SwiGLU. [3]_ For RMS normalization we will use
:class:`mlx.nn.RMSNorm` that is already provided in :mod:`mlx.nn`.

.. code-block:: python

    class LlamaEncoderLayer(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, dims: int, mlp_dims: int, num_heads: int):
            super().__init__()

            self.attention = LlamaAttention(dims, num_heads)

            self.norm1 = nn.RMSNorm(dims)
            self.norm2 = nn.RMSNorm(dims)

            self.linear1 = nn.Linear(dims, mlp_dims, bias=False)
            self.linear2 = nn.Linear(dims, mlp_dims, bias=False)
            self.linear3 = nn.Linear(mlp_dims, dims, bias=False)

        def __call__(self, x, mask=None, cache=None):
            y = self.norm1(x)
            y, cache = self.attention(y, y, y, mask, cache)
            x = x + y

            y = self.norm2(x)
            a = self.linear1(y)
            b = self.linear2(y)
            y = a * mx.sigmoid(a) * b
            y = self.linear3(y)
            x = x + y

            return x, cache

Full model
^^^^^^^^^^

To implement any Llama model we simply have to combine ``LlamaEncoderLayer``
instances with an :class:`mlx.nn.Embedding` to embed the input tokens.

.. code-block:: python

    class Llama(nn.Module):
        def __init__(
            self, num_layers: int, vocab_size: int, dims: int, mlp_dims: int, num_heads: int
        ):
            super().__init__()

            self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, dims)
            self.layers = [
                LlamaEncoderLayer(dims, mlp_dims, num_heads) for _ in range(num_layers)
            ]
            self.norm = nn.RMSNorm(dims)
            self.out_proj = nn.Linear(dims, vocab_size, bias=False)

        def __call__(self, x):
            mask = nn.MultiHeadAttention.create_additive_causal_mask(x.shape[1])
            mask = mask.astype(self.embedding.weight.dtype)

            x = self.embedding(x)
            for l in self.layers:
                x, _ = l(x, mask)
            x = self.norm(x)
            return self.out_proj(x)

Note that in the implementation above we use a simple list to hold the encoder
layers but using ``model.parameters()`` will still consider these layers.

Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Our ``Llama`` module can be used for training but not inference as the
``__call__`` method above processes one input, completely ignores the cache and
performs no sampling whatsoever. In the rest of this subsection, we will
implement the inference function as a python generator that processes the
prompt and then autoregressively yields tokens one at a time.

.. code-block:: python

    class Llama(nn.Module):
        ...

        def generate(self, x, temp=1.0):
            cache = []

            # Make an additive causal mask. We will need that to process the prompt.
            mask = nn.MultiHeadAttention.create_additive_causal_mask(x.shape[1])
            mask = mask.astype(self.embedding.weight.dtype)

            # First we process the prompt x the same way as in __call__ but
            # save the caches in cache
            x = self.embedding(x)
            for l in self.layers:
                x, c = l(x, mask=mask)
                cache.append(c)  # <--- we store the per layer cache in a
                                 #      simple python list
            x = self.norm(x)
            y = self.out_proj(x[:, -1])  # <--- we only care about the last logits
                                         #      that generate the next token
            y = mx.random.categorical(y * (1/temp))

            # y now has size [1]
            # Since MLX is lazily evaluated nothing is computed yet.
            # Calling y.item() would force the computation to happen at
            # this point but we can also choose not to do that and let the
            # user choose when to start the computation.
            yield y

            # Now we parsed the prompt and generated the first token we
            # need to feed it back into the model and loop to generate the
            # rest.
            while True:
                # Unsqueezing the last dimension to add a sequence length
                # dimension of 1
                x = y[:, None]

                x = self.embedding(x)
                for i in range(len(cache)):
                    # We are overwriting the arrays in the cache list. When
                    # the computation will happen, MLX will be discarding the
                    # old cache the moment it is not needed anymore.
                    x, cache[i] = self.layers[i](x, mask=None, cache=cache[i])
                x = self.norm(x)
                y = self.out_proj(x[:, -1])
                y = mx.random.categorical(y * (1/temp))

                yield y

Putting it all together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now have everything we need to create a Llama model and sample tokens from
it. In the following code, we randomly initialize a small Llama model, process
6 tokens of prompt and generate 10 tokens.

.. code-block:: python

    model = Llama(num_layers=12, vocab_size=8192, dims=512, mlp_dims=1024, num_heads=8)

    # Since MLX is lazily evaluated nothing has actually been materialized yet.
    # We could have set the `dims` to 20_000 on a machine with 8GB of RAM and the
    # code above would still run. Let's actually materialize the model.
    mx.eval(model.parameters())

    prompt = mx.array([[1, 10, 8, 32, 44, 7]])  # <-- Note the double brackets because we
                                                #     have a batch dimension even
                                                #     though it is 1 in this case

    generated = [t for i, t in zip(range(10), model.generate(prompt, 0.8))]

    # Since we haven't evaluated anything, nothing is computed yet. The list
    # `generated` contains the arrays that hold the computation graph for the
    # full processing of the prompt and the generation of 10 tokens.
    #
    # We can evaluate them one at a time, or all together. Concatenate them or
    # print them. They would all result in very similar runtimes and give exactly
    # the same results.
    mx.eval(generated)

Converting the weights
----------------------

This section assumes that you have access to the original Llama weights and the
SentencePiece model that comes with them. We will write a small script to
convert the PyTorch weights to MLX compatible ones and write them in a NPZ file
that can be loaded directly by MLX.

.. code-block:: python

    import argparse
    from itertools import starmap

    import numpy as np
    import torch

    def map_torch_to_mlx(key, value):
        if "tok_embedding" in key:
            key = "embedding.weight"

        elif "norm" in key:
            key = key.replace("attention_norm", "norm1").replace("ffn_norm", "norm2")

        elif "wq" in key or "wk" in key or "wv" in key or "wo" in key:
            key = key.replace("wq", "query_proj")
            key = key.replace("wk", "key_proj")
            key = key.replace("wv", "value_proj")
            key = key.replace("wo", "out_proj")

        elif "w1" in key or "w2" in key or "w3" in key:
            # The FFN is a separate submodule in PyTorch
            key = key.replace("feed_forward.w1", "linear1")
            key = key.replace("feed_forward.w3", "linear2")
            key = key.replace("feed_forward.w2", "linear3")

        elif "output" in key:
            key = key.replace("output", "out_proj")

        elif "rope" in key:
            return None, None

        return key, value.numpy()


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Convert Llama weights to MLX")
        parser.add_argument("torch_weights")
        parser.add_argument("output_file")
        args = parser.parse_args()

        state = torch.load(args.torch_weights)
        np.savez(
            args.output_file,
            **{k: v for k, v in starmap(map_torch_to_mlx, state.items()) if k is not None}
        )


Weight loading and benchmarking
-------------------------------

After converting the weights to be compatible to our implementation, all that is
left is to load them from disk and we can finally use the LLM to generate text.
We can load numpy format files using the :func:`mlx.core.load` operation.

To create a parameter dictionary from the key/value representation of NPZ files
we will use the :func:`mlx.utils.tree_unflatten` helper method as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from mlx.utils import tree_unflatten

    model.update(tree_unflatten(list(mx.load(weight_file).items())))

:meth:`mlx.utils.tree_unflatten` will take keys from the NPZ file that look
like ``layers.2.attention.query_proj.weight`` and will transform them to

.. code-block:: python

   {"layers": [..., ..., {"attention": {"query_proj": {"weight": ...}}}]}

which can then be used to update the model. Note that the method above incurs
several unnecessary copies from disk to numpy and then from numpy to MLX. It
will be replaced in the future with direct loading to MLX.

You can download the full example code in `mlx-examples`_. Assuming, the
existence of ``weights.pth`` and ``tokenizer.model`` in the current working
directory we can play around with our inference script as follows (the timings
are representative of an M1 Ultra and the 7B parameter Llama model):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python convert.py weights.pth llama-7B.mlx.npz
    $ python llama.py llama-7B.mlx.npz tokenizer.model 'Call me Ishmael. Some years ago never mind how long precisely'

I watched him attentively for some time, and could not but observe that, though a numerous crowd was hurrying up and down,
    ------
    [INFO] Prompt processing: 0.437 s
    [INFO] Full generation: 4.330 s

We observe that 4.3 seconds are required to generate 100 tokens and 0.4 seconds
of those are spent processing the prompt. This amounts to a little over **39 ms
per token**.

By running with a much bigger prompt we can see that the per token generation
time as well as the prompt processing time remains almost constant.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python llama.py llama-7B.mlx.npz tokenizer.model 'Call me Ishmael.

How should you be waiting?” “That is my secret,” said he. “And you expect him?” “Yes,” said I. “Are you disappointed then, if he does not come?” “No,” said I, “it is his secret, not mine.” “If he comes,” said he, “do you mean to go straight away?” “Yes,” said I, “I cannot be happy if I do not go straight away after him.” “Did you know this place before?” asked he. “Yes,” said I. “Is there any shop to buy food here?” “
