def tree_map(fn, tree, *rest, is_leaf=None):
    """Applies ``fn`` to the leaves of the python tree ``tree`` and
    returns a new collection with the results.

    If ``rest`` is provided, every item is assumed to be a superset of ``tree``
    and the corresponding leaves are provided as extra positional arguments to
    ``fn``. In that respect, :meth:`tree_map` is closer to :func:`itertools.starmap`
    than to :func:`map`.

    ``tree`` similar to :func:`tree_flatten`.
